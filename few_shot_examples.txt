## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SKETCH GENERATION

1. Always generate structured outlines, not full content
2. Use semicolons or bullet points for organization
3. Include key action items or steps
4. Maintain consistent format within each category
5. Focus on intent and structure rather than specific details
6. **Handle obfuscated entities gracefully**: Treat all entity placeholders as generic references
7. **Ignore semantic inconsistencies**: If input says "go to Alice" (person name as location), treat as travel destination
8. **Category obfuscation resilience**: Generate appropriate sketches even when entity categories are mixed up
9. **Value obfuscation tolerance**: Generate same structure regardless of specific entity values
10. **Mixed obfuscation handling**: Process inputs with multiple [TYPE]_value patterns normally
11. Keep sketches concise but comprehensive enough for edge refinement
12. **Privacy-aware**: Never attempt to "correct" or guess the original entities
